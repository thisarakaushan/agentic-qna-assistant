This document provides an overview of typical responsibilities for machine learning roles.

A Machine Learning Engineer is responsible for designing, building, and deploying ML models. 
They work on preprocessing data, training algorithms, and optimizing performance.

Key skills include Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and experience with MLOps tools like MLflow and Airflow. 
Engineers often work with large datasets and focus on scalability, efficiency, and reproducibility.

Additional experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) is often preferred.
