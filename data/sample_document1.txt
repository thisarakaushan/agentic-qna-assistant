This document introduces the basics of Python programming.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Common Python concepts include variables, loops, functions, and data structures.

A 'for' loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence like a list or a string. 
Example: for item in [1, 2, 3]: print(item)

Python is widely used in data science, web development, automation, and artificial intelligence.
